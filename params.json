{"name":"Zist","tagline":"A modern server program to manage and interact with process instances.","body":"# **zist**\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ziscky/zist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ziscky/zist)\r\n\r\n#A simple modern server program to manage and interact process instances.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n##Start Processes (with automatic process restarting)\r\nStart processes using an easy to write config file. Check the examples directory.All you need is:\r\n\r\n - Port\r\n -  Protocol ( *For https a keyfile and certfile are required obviously*)\r\n -  Access Token\r\n - Process Path\r\n - Process Name\r\n\r\nThat's All!!\r\n\r\n## Live Process Interaction\r\n - View process stats i.e cpu/mem usage\r\n -  Start a process and Kill it\r\n - Restart a process\r\n - View a list of all managed processes and valuable information e.g\r\n - *[{\"isalive\":true,\"name\":\"xm\",\"numrestarts\":1,\"path\":\"/home/eziscky/Golang/src/github.com/ziscky/tests/xm\",\"pid\":2067,\"timealive\":\"13.410013177s\",\"timestarted\":\"2015-12-17 13:36:44.540403109 +0300 EAT\"}]*\r\n - Stream stdout/stderr output to a web endpoint, with pretty basic JSON output\r\n\r\n##Crash Reporting\r\n 1. Send a mail of the managed instance context(*configurable*) after the\r\n    crash to a list of emails.\r\n\r\n##Process Detach\r\n - If you don't like the *coupling of your proc's instance with zist* you\r\n   can simply detach it after you're done monitoring it!!\r\n**N.B** *Process Detach is only supported for direct invocation of binaries. So if you run a sh script, I'm working to support that. Or just send in a pull request :)*\r\n\r\n##Process Injection\r\n - Support for config injection to add new processes without restarting zist is in dev. *Basically Live Config Reloading.*\r\n\r\n#NOTE\r\n - Still under moderately heavy development so expect some changes\r\n - Still undergoing refactoring\r\n - Mail Logging is not complete but other supervisor functions are OK.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
